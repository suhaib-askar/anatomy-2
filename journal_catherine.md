Final thoughts

During the initial meeting for this project I felt as though no one wanted to speak up and throw out ideas, so I thought that I might need to take on the role as leader. I volunteered myself to also be the primary github account for our repository.  I was comfortable speaking up and delegating things if I needed to. I own up to missing class during our git/github learning, which might have messed up our project, I was prepared to get myself up to date. During the class I told them to please text me on Slack if you need me to do anything on my end for the repository. I didnâ€™t know what we had covered in class so I had to find out next class, from there I asked a friend who was familiar with and uses git and github frequently to help tutor me the next day. I was able to catch up and connect to the repository to push my files and updates. 

We had delegated that Dale would create the whole body visuals of each system (lymphatic, nervous, muscular, etc.), Vrusha would do the detailed visual anatomy interactions (blood vessels traveling, etc.), and I would create a layout for the the vitamin guide, research css animation libraries, etc. Together we would work on the site design and code. It was taking a while to get any files together from everyone so I instead decided to split up the work a different way, I created a full working page for the vitamin guide section and svg icons for each vitamin while Dale and Vrusha would pair up to work on the animations.

I got more concerned when communication started becoming less frequent, and soon it became a weekly few texts asking/checking if there were any updates. One instance would be when I asked for input on different versions of icons I had created, no one replied until 5 days later. When there were updates, I asked Vrusha and Dale to submit a pull request for them so I could approve the pull request. They did not submit any pull requests and told me to instead to grab their files from our Slack. I did not feel comfortable doing this, as part of this assignment was to use git to push and pull our files. I know I did not commit as often as I should have, I would forget to push my files up or forget the last step of pushing and creating a push request of a new branch. There are many things that we all struggled with and I can only speak from my point of view, I wanted to be fair and honest with my final journal. We all did not bring our best to this project, but I am happy with some of the components we tried.

In the end I know Dale struggled with the javascript and wish he had asked for help, I only saw his final page the day of the presentation but he learned some good javascript functions even though the functionality needed a bit of work. Vrusha was able to learn how to do svg animations. I struggled with coming up with a design layout and more content, as well as accidentally flipping the responsive code of the mobile screens to large screens. I know I tried my best to work with what I was given and wanted to prove I learned the concepts of this course, I think I have proven that I understand them and will use them in future projects. I know we all struggled to work with git and this confusion hindered our collaboration. I still hope that this work will not go to waste from the skills we developed and hopefully be able to create a stronger final product. I know this class was a struggle but I feel that I came out learning the basics of these interesting new technologies and concepts. 

**Positives:**
- Dale created great design elements, logo and initial flat design of body
- Dale was able to learn how to use javascript functions
- Vrusha set up a Slack channel instantly to create a flow of communication
- Vrusha was able to get the svg animations to animate in a few different ways
- We challenged our skillsets

**Negatives:**
- Poor communication
- Rare use of git / github
- Collaboration was not really possible, when no one communicates
- Took too long with some basic work

**What I would do over:**
Having a better conversation of what the page content should be on each page would have definitely made the project cohesive. I would have taken over the project a little more and delegated in a stronger way of what needs to get done, I regret not being stricter about this but I did not want to come off as rude. I feel regret about not coming up with more page content and wish we all would have created a stronger back bone from the beginning.
